# Fix Cursor App Signature Validation Error

This command re-signs the Cursor application with an ad-hoc signature to fix signature validation issues (error `SecCodeCheckValidity`, code `-67062`).

```bash
codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Cursor.app
```

## Command Breakdown

- `codesign` - macOS utility for app signing and verification
- `--force` - overwrites existing signature
- `--deep` - recursively signs all nested resources and libraries
- `--sign -` - applies temporary (ad-hoc) signature
- `/Applications/Cursor.app` - target application

## Why It Works

Error `SecCodeCheckValidity: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-67062` indicates macOS couldn't verify the app's digital signature. This usually happens after:
- App updates
- System updates
- Incorrect installation

The command creates a new valid (but unofficial) signature that resolves the error.

## Safety

Safe if you trust the app source. The only caveat is the unofficial (ad-hoc) signature. To restore official signature, reinstall from developer's website.
